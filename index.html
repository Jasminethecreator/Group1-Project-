      <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>After finding confidence in her new self-image during college and with the encouragement from her friends, Lyndsey decided to pursue modeling. Searching for model work was not easy, for two years every agency she approached turned her down. Lyndsey’s parents even started to get discourage and tried to convince her to go back to Computer Science. However, in 2008 things started to slowly pick-up and she was contracted by Click Model Management of New York City. Unfortunately, “Click” did not see Lyndsey’s full potential as a model because she was considered too old at the age of 24 so they recommended that she say she was 5 years younger. During this residency, Lyndsey was featured in videos for Elle Girl.
          In 2009, while passing out flyers for a side job, she got the infamous call from fashion house Calvin Klein, becoming the first black model to sign an exclusive runway contract with them. This moment in her modeling career created a domino effect.  Up into the year of 2010, other prestigious fashion houses such as Prada, Gucci, Baby Phat, Fendi, and several others called on Lyndsey to walk their runways. She also changed agencies to Elite Model Management. In 2013 she was answering questions on Quora about her life experiences she attention to her programming skills.</p>
